This is a very filling and satisfying breakfast meal. This recipe will also teach you how to make the perfect runny eggs.

>**Prep time:** None
>**Difficulty:** Easy
>**Serves:** 1

## Ingredients
* Two slices of bread
* Two eggs
* A tin of beans
* Oil (for frying eggs)
* Butter (for spreading toast)
* Grated cheese (for topping)
* Salt and pepper
* A tablspoon of water

## Method
1. Pop the **bread** into the toaster and make toast.
2. Transfer the **baked beans** from tin into a microwavable dish and heat up in the microwave for 2 minutes, stirring halfway through cooking time.
3. Heat up a little bit of **oil** in a frying pan and crack in both the **eggs**. Sprinkle **salt and pepper** over the eggs. Add the tablespoon of **water** into the pan between the eggs. Turn the heat to low-medium and cover the pan with a lid (the trapped steam helps cook the top of the egg without overcooking the bottom of the egg). Cook until the clear goopy stuff turns white but the yolk is still golden.
4. Spread the toast with **butter** and place an egg on each bit of toast.
5. Top the eggs with the baked beans.
6. Sprinkle some **grated cheese** and you're done!
