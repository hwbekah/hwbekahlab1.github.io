<h2>Purpose of this website</h2>
<p>This website was created as part of an assessment to test my knowledge and implementation of Git, GitHub, GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and Markdown. The aim of creating this website was to familiarise myself with GitHub which consisted of, but not limited to, creating a repository, writing a README file, adding folders and various types of files to GitHub, using Markdown to create posts...  </p>

<h2>What will I find on this website?</h2>
<p>I decided to make this website a recipe blog, primarily because I thought it would be a good way to practice using the Markdown language and to understand how Jekyll works. I post recipes of food that I enjoy eating and cooking at home.</p>
