Through this blog, I am learning how to use Git, GitHub, Jekyll, and Markdown to create a website and blog.

I learned that **Git** is a version control system that tracks changed to files in a project over time. It is primarily used for progamming projects, often collaborative.

GitHub is a web hosted service for the source code of projects (web and software) that use Git. It lets developers investigate, collaborate, download, use, improve, and remix code of other developers.

GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted for free by GitHub.

Jekyll is a static site generator. When used with GitHub, Jekyll will automatically re-generate all the HTML pages for the website each time a file is committed.

Markdown is a markup language that enables a quicker way to write HTML quickly.
