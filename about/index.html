>Through this blog, I am learning how to use Git, GitHub, Jekyll, and Markdown to create a website and blog.
>
>I learned that Git is a version control system that tracks changed to files in a project over time. It is primarily used for progamming projects, often collaborative.
>
>GitHub is a web hosted service for the source code of projects (web and software) that use Git. It lets developers investigate, collaborate, download, use, improve, and remix code of other developers.
>
>GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted for free by GitHub.
>
>Jekyll is a static site generator. When used with GitHub, Jekyll will automatically re-generate all the HTML pages for the website each time a file is committed.
>
>Markdown is a markup language that enables a quicker way to write HTML quickly.
